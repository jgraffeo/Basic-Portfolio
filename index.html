                    <p>My name is Justin. I'm 31 years old. I've been working as a case manager in social services
                    for over five years. I've lived in Florida, Texas, Nicaragua, and Colombia. Aside from working in 
                    case management, I taught English while living in León and Medellín and have lived and worked on
                    farms in Washington and Colorado. I've joined this Bootcamp to gain new skills, change fields, 
                    make more money, and be creative while doing so. My favorite things to do are travel, make music, 
                    and explore in nature.
